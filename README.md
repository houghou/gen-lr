# gen-lr: Generalized linear regression in Python
This python script provides a genearlized linear least squares solver by combining:
* Unconstrained linear least squares regression (LLS);
* Non-negative linear least squares regression (NNLS);
* Bounded variable linear least squares regression (BVLS).

The script also accepts an optional variance vector for weighting the dependent variable **Y**.
